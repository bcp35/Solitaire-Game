# Solitaire Game

This folder contains the code for both a Command Line Interface version and a Graphical User Interface Version of the card game Solitaire.

The CLI version can be played by running the SolitaireCLI.py file. This may require installation of the numpy package (https://numpy.org/)

The GUI version uses all the other python files, but is played by running the GameManager.py file. This also uses numpy, but also may require installation of PyQt6 (https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/).
